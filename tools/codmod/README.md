# **Google Cloud App Modernization Assessment (codmod)**

Google Cloud Migration Center's App Modernization Assessment tool, also known as codmod. 

This tool is designed to accelerate the application modernization process by providing a detailed analysis of your existing applications.

For the complete documentation, please visit the official [Google Cloud App Modernization Assessment documentation](https://cloud.google.com/migration-center/docs/app-modernization-assessment).

## **Overview**

The App Modernization Assessment (codmod) is an AI-powered, portable command-line interface (CLI) tool that automates the modernization assessment for your applications. It leverages Google's Gemini models to analyze source code and deliver recommendations based on Google Cloud best practices.

The primary goal of codmod is to significantly reduce the time required for a typical modernization assessment from weeks to just a few hours. It provides stakeholders with evidence-based insights into an application's architecture, functionality, and potential blockers for cloud transformation.

## **Key Features**

* **AI-Powered Analysis:** Uses Gemini to analyze source code for deep insights and recommendations.  
* **Time Efficiency:** Drastically reduces assessment time, allowing for faster decision-making.  
* **Evidence-Based Reports:** Generates detailed HTML reports that highlight the application's architecture and identify potential modernization challenges.  
* **Targeted Transformation Intents:** Can focus the assessment on specific modernization goals, such as:  
  * .NET modernization  
  * Transforming workloads from other cloud providers to Google Cloud  
  * Upgrading legacy Java applications (e.g., from Java 8 to Java 21\)  
* **Cost Estimation:** Includes a feature to estimate the cost of the assessment based on the size of the codebase.  
* **Customizable Reports:** Allows for the creation of custom reports and modification of existing ones to focus on specific areas of interest.

## **Target Audience**

This tool is intended for the following roles:

* IT Architects  
* Decision Makers  
* Application Owners

## **How It Works**

1. **Setup:** The codmod CLI tool is installed on a Linux or Windows workstation.  
2. **Authentication:** The user authenticates with a Google Cloud project where the Vertex AI API is enabled.  
3. **Assessment:** The user runs the codmod create command, pointing to the application's source code directory.  
4. **Report Generation:** The tool analyzes the code and generates a comprehensive report in HTML format, which is saved to a specified output path.

By providing clear visibility into the required changes and the benefits of transforming applications to Google Cloud, codmod helps expedite the entire modernization journey.
