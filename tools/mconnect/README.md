# MConnect

A command line interface used to export and merge information from Migration Center and CAST to BigQuery, which allows you to perform data analysis in Looker Studio.

## Before you begin
Before you use MConnect, perform the following steps:

1. Create a Google Account and Google Cloud account.
2. Create a Google Cloud project and enable the [BigQuery](https://pantheon.corp.google.com/apis/library/bigquery.googleapis.com) and [Migration Center](https://pantheon.corp.google.com/apis/library/migrationcenter.googleapis.com) API.
    * For Migration Center, see: [Getting started with Migration Center](https://cloud.google.com/migration-center/docs/get-started-with-migration-center).
    * For BigQuery, see: [Getting started with BigQuery](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6255052?hl=en#zippy=%2Cget-started).
    * Migration Center currently supports regions `us-central1` and `europe-west1`.
3. Create a CAST Highlights report named 'analysisResults.csv'.
4. Populate Migration Center with the assets related to the applications in the CAST report.
    * For more information see: [Asset Discovery](https://cloud.google.com/migration-center/docs/start-asset-discovery).
5. Install the gcloud CLI.
    * For more information see: [gcloud install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)


## Recommended Usage Steps

### Step 1: Build from source

```sh
go build .
```

### Step 2: Authenticate with gcloud

```sh
gcloud init
gcloud auth application-default login
``` 
Make sure the account you're using has the necessary permissions to create/delete groups in Migration Center, and to create and delete tables in BigQuery in the specific project you would like to use.

### Step 3: Create groups In Migration Center

```sh
mconnect create-groups --path=path/to/cast/analysisResults.csv --project=my-project-id --region=my-region1
``` 

This command creates a group in Migration Center for each application in the CAST report file. Each group in Migration Center has the 'mconnect' label.

### Step 4: Assign assets to groups (**manual step**)

In Migration Center, assign your assets to their corresponding application groups created in step '3'. Do this using the [Migration Center UI](https://cloud.google.com/migration-center/docs/create-groups#add_and_remove_assets_from_a_group) or API.

### Step 5: Export CAST report and Migration Center data to BigQuery

```sh
mconnect export --path=path/to/cast/analysisResults.csv --project=my-project-id --region=my-region1 --dataset=dataset-id 
``` 

This command performs two actions:

1. It creates a new table in BigQuery called 'castResults' and populates it with the CAST report data.
2. It exports your Migration Center data to BigQuery. The final result in BigQuery will be the creation of a dataset which has three tables named 'assets', 'groups', and 'preference_sets' containing your data.

### Step 6: Create views in BigQuery

```sh
mconnect create-views --project=my-project-id --dataset=dataset-id
``` 
This creates three views ('migrationcenterinfra_vw', 'castreadiness_vw', 'mccastreadinesscombined_vw') in BigQuery using Migration Center and CAST data.
The output of this command provides a link to a Looker Studio report using the 'mccastreadinesscombined_vw' view.

Make sure to use the **same** project-id and dataset-id as in step 5.

### Step 7: Setup Looker Studio's Report

#### Using the provided link

1. Copy the link obtained in the previous step to your web browser.
2. Click 'Save and Share' and then 'Acknowledge and save'.

#### Manually copying -

If the link provided is broken, you could manually set up the Looker Studio Report using your data:

1. In Looker Studio, open the 'Migration Center / CAST Analysis' report, click the three dots at the top of the page.
2. Click 'Make a copy', and then 'Copy Report'.
3. In the new report, click 'resources', and then 'Manage added data sources'.
4. Using the datasource named: 'McCastReadinessCombined_vw', click 'EDIT'.
5. Provide the project-id and the dataset-id used in step '6' and choose 'mccastreadinesscombined_vw'.
6. Click 'RECONNECT', and then 'Apply'.
7. Click 'DONE' and refresh the page.

This creates a 'Migration Center / CAST Analysis' report using your data.
